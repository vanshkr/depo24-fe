# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Getting Started
To get started with FE on Vite, follow these simple steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>

Install Dependencies: Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
npm install

Run Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:
npm run dev

Start Coding: With the development server running, start coding! Any changes you make will be hot-reloaded instantly in the browser.
